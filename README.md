# Facebook Engagement Metrics Analysis

This project analyzes Facebook post engagement to understand which types of content perform best. It focuses on key metrics such as likes, shares, comments, and overall engagement rate to provide actionable insights for social media strategy. The analysis is conducted using both Python (for data preparation and EDA) and Power BI (for visualization and dashboard creation).



## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to evaluate engagement performance on a dataset of Facebook posts using data analytics and visualization tools. The project includes:

- Cleaning and preprocessing raw Facebook engagement data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
- Building an interactive dashboard using Power BI
- Identifying trends and patterns in content performance



## Key Metrics Analyzed

- Total Likes, Shares, and Comments
- Post Types (e.g., Link, Photo, Video, Status)
- Engagement Rate per Post
- Posting Frequency and Reach Trends
- Time-based engagement patterns (e.g., day of week, time of post)



## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA and initial insights
- Power BI for creating interactive dashboards
- CSV dataset for Facebook post analytics



## Objective

To understand how users interact with Facebook content and uncover insights that can inform content planning, posting schedules, and marketing strategies. This analysis helps in identifying what kind of posts receive more attention and which time slots are most effective.
